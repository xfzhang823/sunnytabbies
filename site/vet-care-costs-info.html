      <h2>First-Year Veterinary Care Cost: What to Expect</h2>

      <p>
        For healthy kittens,
        <strong>first-year veterinary care is mostly preventive</strong>, and
        typically includes:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          Completing the final kitten vaccine booster (if not already done)
        </li>
        <li>Rabies vaccination</li>
        <li>One or two routine wellness exams</li>
        <li>Basic parasite prevention as recommended by your veterinarian</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        In <strong>Massachusetts</strong>, adopters typically spend about
        <strong>$200–$300 per kitten</strong> on routine preventive care in the
        first year. For <strong>two kittens</strong>, that’s usually
        <strong>$400–$600 total</strong>, assuming everything goes smoothly.
      </p>

      <p>
        Some veterinary clinics offer <strong>wellness plans</strong> that
        bundle routine exams and vaccines into a predictable monthly or annual
        cost. These plans are generally comparable to paying out-of-pocket
        (sometimes with a small per-visit discount) and are mainly about
        convenience and budgeting.
      </p>

      <h3>What about pet insurance?</h3>

      <p>
        Pet insurance is optional but worth considering. Most plans focus on
        <strong>accidents and unexpected illnesses</strong>, not routine care
        (unless you add a wellness rider).
      </p>

      <p>
        That said, first-time or less experienced cat owners often make urgent
        or after-hours vet visits, especially in the first year. These visits
        can be expensive (often <strong>$300+ per visit</strong>, not including
        diagnostics or procedures), and many turn out not to be true
        emergencies. Even when nothing serious is found, a few precautionary
        visits can add up quickly—this is where insurance can help a lot.
      </p>

      <p><strong>Many adopters choose to:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Self-pay routine preventive care, and</li>
        <li>
          Use pet insurance as a safety net for unexpected or urgent situations.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p class="muted">
        There’s no single “right” approach — it depends on your budgeting style
        and risk tolerance.
