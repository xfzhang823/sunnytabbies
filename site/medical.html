      <h2>Understanding the FVRCP Vaccine (the “3-shot series”)</h2>

      <p>
        Kittens receive a core vaccine called <strong>FVRCP</strong>, which
        protects against three major feline viruses: rhinotracheitis,
        calicivirus, and panleukopenia. Because their immune system is still
        developing, the vaccine needs to be given as a
        <strong>series of three shots</strong> to fully protect them.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Shot #1 – Starter dose (around 6–8 weeks old):</strong>
          Begins building immunity. The kitten gets partial protection.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Shot #2 – Booster (around 10–12 weeks old):</strong>
          Strengthens the immune response and fills in gaps from the first dose.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong
            >Shot #3 – Final kitten booster (around 14–16 weeks old):</strong
          >
          Completes the series and provides longer-term protection into
          adulthood.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        After completing all three shots, kittens usually receive an
        <strong>annual booster</strong> as adults. Our kittens have already
        started the FVRCP series, and your vet will help you finish any
        remaining doses on schedule.
      </p>

      <p class="subtle">
        The medical documents will tell you exactly which shots your kitten has
        already received and which ones are still due so you can share that info
        with your vet.
      </p>

      <p>
        Kittens also receive a separate rabies vaccine, usually around 12–16
        weeks of age (often at the same visit as the 3rd FVRCP booster). This
        vaccine is required by law in Massachusetts and most other states, and
        your vet will give it once the kitten is old enough. Most cat sitters,
        pet hotels, and groomers may also require a current rabies certificate
        before accepting a cat.

      <h3>What These Vaccines Actually Do</h3>

      <p>
        It’s important to know that vaccines are not magical amulets that stop
        viruses entirely. Like us, animals naturally co-exist with germs and
        viruses in their environment. The vaccine doesn’t prevent exposure — it
        prevents serious illness.
      </p>

      <p>
        This is also why mild issues like conjunctivitis or small
        upper-respiratory symptoms can still happen in kittens, even with great
        care and proper vaccination. These infections are extremely common and
        not 100% avoidable. Most of the time, the kitten’s own immune system
        kicks in and the symptoms clear up with rest and supportive care.
      </p>

      <p>
        What the vaccine does is teach their immune system how to respond
        quickly, so if they do get exposed to these common viruses, the symptoms
        stay much milder, shorter, and far less dangerous than they would be
        without vaccination.
      </p>

      <p>
        This is why the full 3-shot series matters: each dose strengthens that
        immune response until it’s mature enough to offer reliable protection.
