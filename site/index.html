      <h2>Behind the Scenes of Sunny Tabbies</h2>

      <p>
        <strong>Sunny Tabbies is a personal project in every sense.</strong
        ><br />
        I’m a video-editing hobbyist and I know Python fairly well — but before
        this, I knew almost nothing about front-end development. I’m not in
        animal rescue or welfare. I’m just someone using tech and film to give
        these kittens the best possible digital résumé and help them find
        families who will appreciate their journey as much as I do, as well as
        having a place to preserve and share that journey along the way.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>The visuals.</strong><br />
        All photos and videos were shot by me on a Nikon D7500 and DJI Osmo,
        recorded in 4K, and edited & color-graded in DaVinci Resolve — nothing
        fancy, mainly gentle color shaping and contrast to make the colors pop.
        The music is hand-selected from Artlist.io to match the mood of each
        moment.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>No AI-generated media.</strong><br />
        None of the images or videos are generated or altered by AI. What you’re
        seeing are real timestamps, real clips, and real moments.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>The tech.</strong><br />
        The site was built from scratch using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with
        heavy help from modern AI tools (mostly “vibe coding”). I also wrote
        Python scripts to organize media files, generate thumbnails, and manage
        metadata.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>The heart.</strong><br />
        Because I spend real time with these kittens every day, I know their
        quirks and personalities. The camera just captures what’s already there.
